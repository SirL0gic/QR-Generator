					<div class="faq-body">
						<p>A QR Code is a two-dimensional barcode that typically consists of patterns of black and white pixels. They were created by Denso Wave, a Japanese division of Toyota supplier Denso, to mark components and speed up the logistics of their auto manufacturing. Due to the widespread use of smartphones, it is now being used in mobile marketing. Quick Response, or "QR," is a term that refers to the instant access to the data that is concealed in the Code.</p>

					<h1 class="faq-page">How to use QR codes?</h1>
					<div class="faq-body">
						<p>You might already have a built-in QR Code reader or scanner, depending on your device. Your phone's camera app should be open. Hold it over a Code for a short period of time until a notification appears. Check your settings to see if QR Code scanning is enabled if this doesn't occur. Still not functioning? You only need to download third-party QR Code readers from your pp stores at this point, so don't worry.</p>
